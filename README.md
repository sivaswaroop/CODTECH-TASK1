### objective
The objective of this project is to preform EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) on a IRIS dataset containing Sepal,Petal of their length and width.The aim is to uncover insights into correlations,and outliers through visualizations.

### Key Activities
- **Data Visualizations**:Creating visulizations to understand data distributions,trends and relationships.
- **Correlations Analysis**:Identifying correlations between populations figures across different length and width

### Technologies Used
- **Python**:The primary programming language for data analysis
- **Pandas**:Used for Data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**:Employed for creatinng static,animated and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**:Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.
